# P2-MoonRun
A 2D platformer game by Logan Summers

This project is based on the requirements of my game programming class.

# Instructions For The Game
Use the "Left" and "Right" arrow keys to move left and right. Use the "Spacebar" to jump and the "Down" arrow to crouch. Grab the coins and reach the flag!

## Project Report
As I was finishing up this project I realized that I had a lot more fun with this one than I did on project 1. There was a lot more creative freedom in what the player can do and how the level is designed. There are definently a lot of new concepts and abilities that I learned. The hardest of which was figuring what to add to the game to "juice it up". All in all though, I had a lot of fun with this project and look forward to learning 3D.

## Juice
The first example of juice I added to my game was some dust particles that emit from the player when they land. This is to make it seem more realistic to being on the moon. 

The second example of juice I added was the character doing a victory dance once they reach their goal. It gives the character more emotion and characteristics

The third example of juice is that I added a little screen shake effect when the character falls far enough so that it gives the effect of a longer fall making you land harder.
