# P2-MoonRun
A 2D platformer game by Logan Summers

This project is based on the requirements of my game programming class.

# Instructions For The Game
Use the "Left" and "Right" arrow keys to move left and right. Use the "Spacebar" to jump and the "Down" arrow to crouch. Grab the coin and reach the flag!

## Project Report
The beggining of this project turned out to be so much easier than the previous project. This is majorly due to already having the knowledge needed to get all of the basics set up. That being said, I still had troubles here and there. The main one that I ran into was making sure I reformatted my code correctly to fit the adopted style guide. Im very excited to see what more I can do with this project in the next iteration.

## Juice
The first bit of juice I added to my game was some dust particles that emit from the player when they land. This is to make it seem more realistic to being on the moon. 

The second but of juice I added was the character doing a victory dance once they reach their goal. It gives the character more emotion and characteristics
